# logtracer and Showlog

LogTracer is a program that has been desingated to "trace" corda transactions and flows in a given log. This program is not finished and still in development.

ShowLog: This program has been designated to "change" default layout of logs coming from C5; to allow Support Egineers to analyse logs in an easier way without all verbosity of JSON or CSV format may contain... At the moment, it support JSON reading, and it works using command line flags, i'm adding some "interactive" support but this is still under deveploment.
